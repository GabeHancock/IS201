        Course Information
        Description
        The topics covered in the course are applicable to students in all majors and will be useful to you throughout both your academic and professional career. This course is valuable because information technology is one of the biggest drivers of strategic competitive advantage in the market. The ability to collect, use, and share information is having dramatic effects on all of our professional and personal lives. Information systems (IS) are changing the way we work, the types of jobs we do, how we communicate, and how we obtain entertainment. We need to be able to turn the vast amounts of data streaming through our society into information and use that information to make good decisions. Doing so allows us to be more effective and efficient. Individuals who possess this ability have a significant advantage over those who do not. This class will help you gain valuable skills in this area.
        
        The emphasis in this course is on the practical application of technology. Topics include essential concepts of computers, software applications, management databases, information systems in organizations, and developing business intelligence through data mining. You will learn several software applications including Excel, Solver, VBA, Data.World, web development, and data mining/visualization applications. This means you need a laptop for this course. A Chromebook will not be sufficient for most of this course (e.g., anything requiring a software download, such as Excel). 
        
        Information systems are becoming increasingly essential in all areas of an organization and the vast majority of IS work cannot be outsourced. The work is both challenging and interesting and the career pays very well. The field offers many opportunities for personal and professional growth and upward mobility. The IS Department in the Marriott School of business is a world leader in IS education. IS graduates at BYU currently boast a consistent 97-100% placement rate and are among the highest paid and most heavily recruited graduates at BYU.

        Prerequisites
        IS 110 (Spreadsheets and Business Analysis) is a co-requisite. If you haven't already taken this class and are not currently enrolled in it, then please enroll now. IS 110 is not a heavy course - just one credit. You can take it concurrently with IS 201 and you can finish it as quickly as you'd like (it can be done completely independently, online, if you carefully read the IS 110 syllabus). Currently, we're working on a test-out option, but BYU is slow to allow those. So, testing out is not an option for this semester. If you are a freshman, we strongly encourage you to attend at least Day 1 if you are able to. If not, then please read the syllabus for that course very carefully. IS 110 is not streamed or recorded.

        Grading Policy
        Final Letter Grades: In compliance with Marriott School policy for the IS 201 class, the final average GPA in the class must be 3.3 (in other words, there is a curve for the class). The average grade in the course is expected to be around an 87%. In the past, we have occasionally curved up because the average was too low. We do not anticipate ever having to curve down. However, there is also no guarantee we will have the flexibility to curve up.
        
        All assessments (Quizzes, HW, Projects, Exams) are administered through MyEducator.com. There is only one attempt per assessment for full credit excluding the Final Web Dev Project (which can be submitted as many times as you want). Be sure to not accidentally miss a quiz or homework. All assignments (including quizzes) are due by 10pm Mountain Time on the indicated due date. Any assignment (including projects and exams) can be submitted late for up to 75% credit. Assignments can be submitted late up until the last day of classes at 10pm. There is also a 2 hour grace period on all submissions. So, no penalty will be applied if the assignment is submitted prior to midnight on the day it is due. We just want you to shoot for 10pm for your sake and ours. We will sometimes (our schedule depending...) stay up on project and exam nights until the deadline. 
        
        Grade Disputes: If you feel an assessment has been graded unfairly or in error, meet with a TA during lab hours. If you cannot receive satisfactory treatment from a TA, you may then contact your professor. I strongly encourage you to read this doc first though: Fair Treatment and Assessment. For the most part, partial credit in this course is only given when everything was done correctly and a super small, single mistake caused the loss of a large number of points. If it is a matter of one or two points, please wait until the end of the semester to see if it will even make a difference. If you made more than one mistake, or if the mistake was more than minor (e.g., due to a lack of understanding of how the code or applications work), then the points were legitimately missed, and returning them would provide an unfair advantage. 
        
        All assessments should be completed by each individual. Students should not work together when completing assessments. You may learn together (we encourage you to learn together), but assess and perform individually. This also means you cannot use work completed by students in prior semesters. This includes 'study help' sites like Quizlet, Chegg, CourseHero, and Slader (and any others that I haven't listed). If you are getting answers to exam/project questions from these kinds of services, then you are cheating. Your work needs to be your work. We actively track the solutions these sites provide, and we can detect solutions used from these sites (yes, even if you customize and edit them so that 'your' answer looks nothing like the answer you got from the site). So, do your soul and your grade a favor and just do your own work. 
        
        What about chatGPT or other large language models? In information systems, we believe in using every legitimate tool at your disposal to accomplish your work. Large language models (LLM) like chatGPT are just tools for helping you get your work done faster, sort of like slide rules (Google it), calculators, and spreadsheets. These are just tools that make it possible to do more and to do so more quickly. With this in mind, can you use such tools in this class to help you write your code? Yes! We hope you will. However, in order to use these tools effectively, you need to know how they work and understand their limitations. One of the biggest current limitations is an abundance of false positives (giving a confident, but incorrect, answer). For example, it will produce code based on a prompt, but that code might not run, or it might run but not achieve the desired result. So, be sure to review and edit whatever these tools produce. As these tools improve, we will inevitably need to adjust the way we teach this (and possibly every) course, just as math and accounting classes had to change once calculators and spreadsheets became ubiquitous. If you choose to use these tools for conceptual questions on assessments, course materials will be the final authority on correct answers, even if the LLM produces a 'confident' answer that differs from course materials. 
        
        Late work and retaking assessments to improve your score. Students have always been allowed to submit any assessment late for up to 75% credit. Students now may also retake any assessment (aside from the exceptions listed below) for up to 75% credit (i.e., if you receive 100% on your retake, you would earn 75%, if you receive 80% on the retake, you would earn 60%). To request a retake, reach out to the TAs (either in the lab or via email if they have listed their email on Learning Suite) that are assigned to your professor. When they reset your assessment, it will erase your prior score and so you must retake that assessment in order to receive any score. You will have until the last day of finals to submit your work. No new retake requests will be granted after the last final exam day (see BYU calendar). This option to retake only makes sense for those who scored lower than a 75% on the assessment during their first submission. Only one retake is permitted per assessment. If solutions are provided in the MyEducator feedback for incorrect responses on initial attempts, this feedback cannot be used as reference when retaking an assessment. Here are the exceptions which may not be retaken (but which may be submitted late with the usual 25% late penalty)
        
        Reading quizzes
        Big Quiz 1 (IS in Orgs)
        Final Project/Exam
        Open Book: Aside from the quiz portion of the final, the assignments are all open-note, open-book, open-internet, but closed-neighbor. Despite all assessments being open-internet, this does not give permission for blatant cheating (e.g., googling 'IS 201 BYU database midterm' or searching for a specific question on the assessment). If you use someone else's work, then it is cheating.
        
        Extra Credit: Extra credit is offered by some professors. Most allow up to 1% total extra credit. This includes SONA studies, finding typos in MyEducator (send to Prof Gaskin), and occasionally other things that they will email you about. The BYU SONA research lab gives you 'credits' for completing studies. These credits are each worth 25% extra credit in this course. So, four SONA credits will result in full extra credit for this course. Your SONA participation does not get sent to your professor until after finals. So, you will not see this credit show up in Learning Suite until after finals. 
        
        Classroom Procedures
        Professionalism
        
        As in all business classes, students are expected to act professionally inside and outside of the classroom. This includes the following:
        
        Email communication. Email is a great way to communicate with your instructor and TAs. However, in large classes like this one, we often get mounds of emails. As a result, emailing us with a question or problem is no guarantee or promise of a response or a solution. We help those who show up to office hours and lab hours first and then answer emails with the time we have left. Therefore, if you have a pressing concern, the only guaranteed method for help is to show up to lab/office hours. However, know that we truly DO want to help you and that we are usually flexible with setting up meetings outside of our normal office and lab hours. Being professional in your email communication means being respectful of this rule and not expecting that all responsibility for your struggles is shifted to the TAs because you sent an email.
        Appropriate use of TA Help. Contact TAs for help with homework and for questions concerning software applications, grading, and the posting of grades on MyEducator and transferred to Learning Suite. The TAs are a valuable resource and are willing to help you succeed in this class. However, the TAs will NOT divulge solutions or 'pre-grade' any assignments. In other words, they will help you understand a specific concept but, they will NOT give you a solution or tell you if your solution is correct. In the work world, your boss expects your work to be valid and correct. This policy encourages you to take responsibility to understand and apply concepts.
        When requesting help from the TAs or professor, we expect that you will have read the background material and have made a reasonable effort to solve the problem beforehand. It is important that you exercise your ability to think and problem-solve before asking the TAs for help. Asking the TA for help when you have not made a sincere effort to complete the problem or assignment is not acceptable. In fact, TAs will not help you unless you have already put forth some reasonable effort on your part. Once you have put forth the necessary effort, TAs will be more than happy to help you better understand concepts. In a similar light, do not wait until the last minute to do homework or projects and expect that the TAs will be available to help you at the last minute. TAs can only serve students on a first-come, first-serve basis during the time TAs have available. So work on projects early. The TA lab tends to get busy immediately before projects are due.
        Courteous Behavior. Professionalism includes treating the professor, TAs, and other class members with courtesy and respect. Examples of discourteous behavior include but are not limited to dominating class discussion time (if applicable), appealing for extra points or regrading without justifiable cause, and making unreasonable demands on the TA's or the professor's time (e.g., spending every day in the TA lab or visiting the professor's office several times each week). We sincerely do want to help you and see you succeed. But with a class of this size, we need to make sure that we are equally available and fair to all students.
        Keep copies of your submissions. Make a BACKUP copy of ALL your project computer files. It is your responsibility to keep copies of all homework assignments in case a score fails to get recorded. We cannot regrade or give partial credit if we have no files to refer back to.
        Accommodations. If you have a letter from the UAC office, you are responsible for initiating the action required to implement any requested accommodations. The TAs and Professor will not proactively implement accommodations without explicit request from the student, although we will happily comply with justified requests for accommodations. 
        Attendance Policy
        For lecture-based sections:
        
        I will not take attendance during class, but you are definitely encouraged to come and participate. I'll do my best to make class time enjoyable and valuable. Nevertheless, the course is designed to be completely doable online, rather than requiring class attendance. If you learn better on your own, you are welcome to take the course completely online without attending a single lecture. For this reason, the lectures intentionally replicate the readings. If you do not learn well on your own, I STRONGLY recommend you make coming to class a priority. 
        
        For online sections:
        
        This is an online-only class. No lecture will be held. If there is room during a lecture, you are welcome to attend, but priority seating will be given to those who are registered for the lecture-based section. Also, be sure to follow the due dates outlined in your section, as the lecture you attend might not follow the same schedule.
        
        Study Habits
        For lecture-based sections:
        
        Before class EXPLORE 
        
        There are lots of prep materials on MyEducator. Don't read every word unless that is how you learn best.
        During class LEARN AND PRACTICE 
        
        Bring laptop
        Learn fundamentals
        Engage in exercises and activities that synthesize and apply concepts and practice skills
        After class CONFIRM AND REVIEW
        
        Quizzes, assignments, projects and exams, PRACTICE, PRACTICE, PRACTICE, PRACTICE, PRACTICE, PRACTICE, PRACTICE, PRACTICE
        For online-only sections:
        
        Stay on top of things! PRACTICE, PRACTICE, PRACTICE, PRACTICE....
        
        Secrets to success in this class: 
        
        1. Practice: Don't just read the book and watch the videos. Do the practice problems and follow along during the videos. 
        
        2. Don't overthink quiz/exam questions: We intentionally wrote them unambiguously. If you're wondering if we might mean something sly, you're overthinking it. 
        
        3. Read instructions and questions carefully: While we don't recommend overthinking, we do recommend careful attentiveness to every detail in a question or prompt. 
        
        4. Learn with others: We strongly encourage you to learn in pairs or groups, but assess individually. Just make sure you leverage others effectively to learn the content, not just to finish the work.
